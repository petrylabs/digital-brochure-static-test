# Project structure

- `/components`: React components
- `/hooks`: React hooks
- `/icons`: SVG icons as React components
- `/pages`: static page templates
- `/scss`: style files
- `/utils`: utility functions

# Styling

- Global styles are imported from `https://www.sonnet.ca/asset/css/sonnet.css` in the custom `_document` file.
- All styles are written in [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) as [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax#scss)
- Common SCSS definitions (variables, mixins, etc.) are located in the `/scss` folder.
- Component-specific styles are kept in SCSS files in each component folder.
- Component styles are leveraging [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules).

## Media queries

Breakpoints are defined in `/scss/global/layout.scss`. Helper mixins for using these breakpoints in media queries are also available in this file, allowing media queries to be written as below:

```scss
@import "../../scss/globals/layout.scss";

@include mq-min-width(sm) {
  // your styles here
}
```

## MUI components

To maintain consistent styling patterns within the app (i.e. relying on CSS Modules), any MUI components used are styled using that component's CSS API and providing classes as a prop. See example below.

```jsx
<Modal classes={{ root: styles.root }}>{/* modal content */}</Modal>
```
