# Styles

This project leverages [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) and all styles are written in [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) as [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax#scss).

Global style definitions (variables, mixins, etc.) are located in the `/scss` folder. Component-specific styles are kept in SCSS files in each component folder.
